# Work In Progress
These are all the notebooks and projects I am working on at the moment but which are not 100% completed yet. Eventually they will be moved to Projects or a different repository. At the moment this is mainly used for projects where I am learning new skills and techniques, expanding to larger projects as need arises.

## Current WIP projects:
 - One-liners: I am trying to learn to code minimalistically and elegantly. Python one-liners are a necessary skill and the next step to achieving that.
 -
